## 🎯 The 30-Second Pitch

> "MEV costs DeFi users $1.5 billion annually. At Qubic's 15 million TPS, this scales exponentially. AFO leverages Qubic's unique tick-based finality to make sandwich attacks structurally impossible - no committees, no off-chain components, zero MEV. This demo proves it works. Only Qubic can do this."

**Memorize this.** You'll use it constantly.

## 🎬 Demo Flow (Quick Reference)

```
1. Launch → ./run-demo.sh
2. Say: "This is AFO on Qubic"
3. Press a, a, a → "Adding user intents"
4. Press x → "Attacker tries to sandwich"
5. Press a, a → "More users"
6. Press 2 → "All pending, attacker here"
7. Press c → "Locking order deterministically"
8. Press 2 → "Attacker stuck, cannot reorder!"
9. Press e → "Execute fairly"
10. Press 3 → "Zero MEV, users protected"
11. Say: "Only possible on Qubic"
```

**Total time: 90 seconds**

## 💬 Q&A Quick Answers

**"How does this compare to Flashbots?"**
→ "Flashbots can't scale to 15M TPS. AFO is built into consensus with zero overhead."

**"What if validators collude?"**
→ "That's consensus-level, affects everything. Qubic's economics prevent this."

**"Performance overhead?"**
→ "Nearly zero. O(n log n) sort is negligible. No extra latency."

**"Can Ethereum do this?"**
→ "No. Public mempool and multi-stage finality create attack windows. Qubic's atomic tick eliminates both."

**"Production ready?"**
→ "Architecture yes. Needs testnet deployment and security audit before mainnet."

## 🎯 Remember These Key Points

1. **The Problem**: $1.5B extracted, $500M from sandwiches
2. **The Solution**: 3 phases - Commit, Lock, Execute
3. **Why Qubic**: Atomic tick finality (1 tick = order + consensus + execute)
4. **The Demo**: Watch attacker get stuck in locked order
5. **The Impact**: Zero MEV, billion dollars retained
